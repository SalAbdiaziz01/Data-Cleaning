# Data Cleaning Examples

**Goal:** Demonstrate practical data-cleaning workflows for real-world datasets, including handling missing values, fixing data types, detecting outliers, and preparing data for analysis.

---

## 📊 Data
- Multiple sample CSV datasets (small, educational scale)
- Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different cleaning tasks
- PDF cheat-sheets included for reference

---

## 🔎 Method
- Identified and filled/removing missing values  
- Corrected inconsistent data types (e.g., strings → dates, floats → ints)  
- Detected outliers and anomalies with statistical methods  
- Renamed and reformatted columns for clarity  
- Prepared cleaned datasets for analysis or modelling  

---

## ✅ Key Skills Shown
- pandas for data wrangling  
- Python for automation of repetitive cleaning tasks  
- Documentation of workflows (notebooks + PDFs)
